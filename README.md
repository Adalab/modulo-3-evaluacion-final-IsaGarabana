Well hello hello, welcome to my Hogwarts character search!
I have developed a website that allows you to find Harry Potter characters and some of their life details.

By fetching the [Harry-Potter API](https://hp-api.herokuapp.com/), this SPA developed with REACT searchs on the API database and brings all the characters for you.

I have developed this website as part of my training as developer in the Adalab Bootcamp, and the web itself will be my REACT command evaluation.

As you can see, I haven't put much effort on CSS styles (at least not yet), as I've put all my effort on REACT code to be neat and strong.
